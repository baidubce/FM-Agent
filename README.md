## Introduction
FM Agent is a novel, general-purpose multi-agent framework that addresses complex real-world challenges by synergistically combining LLM-based reasoning and large-scale evolutionary search. The core of FM Agent integrates several key innovations: 1) a cold-start initialization phase incorporating expert guidance, 2) a novel evolutionary sampling strategy for iterative optimization, 3) domain-specific evaluators that combine correctness, effectiveness, and LLM-supervised feedback, and 4) a distributed, asynchronous execution infrastructure built on Ray. Demonstrating broad applicability, our system has been evaluated across diverse domains, including operations research, machine learning, GPU kernel optimization, and classical mathematical problems.



## Performance Metrics
FM Agent reaches state-of-the-art results autonomously, without human interpretation or tuning â€” 1976.3 on ALE-Bench (+5.2%), 43.56% on MLE-Bench (+4.0pp), up to 20Ã— speedups on KernelBench, and establishes new state-of-the-art(SOTA) results on several classical mathematical problems.
